Python
======

In shared facilities, ``Python`` is commonly managed using tools like ``Conda`` and ``Anaconda`` to ensure efficient and reliable environment management. 
On DMOG, the flight environment ``Conda`` and the ``Anaconda`` modules, offer a comprehensive solution for creating isolated and reproducible 
``Python`` environments. These environments allow multiple users to work on the same system without conflicts, as each user can have their own 
customized ``Python`` environment with specific package versions and dependencies. 

This approach ensures that Python-based projects on DMOG can be executed reliably and with minimal compatibility issues, enabling collaborative research 
and streamlined workflows.
