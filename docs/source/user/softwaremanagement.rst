Software Management
===================

System software
---------------

HPC clusters typically have many users with varying software requirements and installing software for each
user can be time-consuming and may lead to conflicts between different versions of the same software.

``Modules`` provide a way to manage software installations and make different versions of the same 
software available to users on demand. With modules, users can load and unload different versions of 
software into their environment without interfering with other users or the system's default settings. 
This makes it easy for users to work with different versions of the same software or to use different 
software packages for different projects or workflows.
