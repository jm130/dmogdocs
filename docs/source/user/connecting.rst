Connecting to DMOG
==================

Before following the process below, this guide assumes you have an account on the cluster. 
If that is not the case, you can request one by contacting ISHelp@hw.ac.uk

Interaction with DMOG is done remotely via SSH (Shecure Shell). 
To connect to another machine using SSH you need to have a SSH client program installed on your machine. 
macOS, Linux, and newer versions of Windows come with a command-line (text-only) SSH client pre-installed. 
On older Windows versions there are various graphical SSH clients you can use like PuTTY or MobaXterm.

Using your favorite ssh-client, just type:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh <username>@dmog.hw.ac.uk

Note: the cluster is accessible within the University network. For remote access you need to log on 
to the `University VPN <https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/services/is/it-essentials/virtual-private-network-vpn.htm>`_  first.
