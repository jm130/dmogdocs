DMOG User Guide
===================================

Welcome to the documentation page for DMOG, the new high-performance computing (HPC) 
facility at Heriot-Watt University. DMOG is a state-of-the-art cluster that aligns 
with the University Strategy 2025, which aims to support and enable world-leading research.

The cluster is named after Dame Maria Ogilvie Gordona pioneering geologist who began her 
scientific career at Heriot-Watt College in 1888. She was the first woman to receive a 
Doctor of Science from UCL and a PhD from Munich University. Maria combined academic 
research with married life and work for the Liberal Party and women’s action groups. 
She won the Geological Society Lyell medal for research on plate tectonics and became a 
Dame of the British Empire for her work for women’s rights.

This documentation page serves as a comprehensive guide to using the DMOG cluster, 
including information on accessing the system, submitting jobs, and utilizing the various 
software packages and tools available. We hope you find this resource helpful in your 
research endeavors.
