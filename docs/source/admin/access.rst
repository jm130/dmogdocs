Access and Priorization
=======================

Access to the HPC cluster is granted to research staff and research students by default, 
and is free at the point of use. To gain access, users are required to fill out 
a `TopDesk <https://hwu.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=8ef782731230451b8360322938f2e6e4>`_ 
form providing basic information about their research and the expected resource requirements. 
The HPC team will review each application and grant access in a timely manner.

For those with specific and/or time-sensitive research requirements, a paid priority access 
service is available. This provides access to higher priority in the job queues.
Please contact us for more information on this service.
