Info Scripts
============

We have created a number of infromational scripts to allow users to see more information about their jobs, as well as the cluster itself.

These scripts are located in /opt/site/hwscripts/

hwNodes: This script will show you information on each node in the cluster, how many CPU cores, GPUs, and how much memory they have. It also displays the current usage information, how many CPU cores, GPUs, or memory are currently in use.

hwStatus: This small script shows a very high level overview of the cluster, how many CPU cores and GPUs are in use in total, how many active jobs there are, and how many are waiting in the queue.

hwEfficiency: This script will show you various information about a given users jobs that have run over a given timeframe. Total Number of jobs, average CPU efficiency of those jobs, average memory efficiency, average wait time (time in the queue before starting), and average runtime.
