General Use Policy
==================

The DOMG HPC cluster is a shared resource that has been set up to support research. 
It is a powerful and valuable resource that can be used to 
undertake computationally intensive tasks that would otherwise not be possible. It is 
important to remember that this resource is shared by all users and must, therefore, be used 
responsibly. Each user has a responsibility to ensure that their use of the resource does not 
negatively impact other users, and that they do not misuse the resource in any way.

The facility is to be used only for research purposes. This means that it should not be used 
for any other purposes, such as commercial or personal activities. Any misuse of the facility 
will not be tolerated, and users who violate the usage policy will be subject to disciplinary 
action, which may include suspension or termination of their access to the facility.

As a user of DMOG, you will be associated with a group that will have a designated line manager. 
The line manager is responsible for managing the group's accounts and ensuring that the group's usage of the 
HPC facility follows our guidelines. This includes deciding on the data stored in the user accounts, 
as well as managing access to the accounts. If a user leaves the group, their account will remain under the 
management of the line manager, who will ultimately decide what to do with the account. This ensures that 
access to our HPC facility is managed appropriately and that users are held accountable for their usage.

It is essential that all users of the facility adhere to the guidelines outlined in the documentation.
The facility staff is available to provide support and assistance to users, and they can be contacted 
if any issues or concerns arise. By working together and using the facility responsibly, we 
can ensure that the facility remains a valuable resource for the research community.
