As a user of our HPC facility, you will be associated with a group that will have a designated line manager. 
The line manager is responsible for managing the group's accounts and ensuring that the group's usage of the 
HPC facility follows our policies and guidelines. This includes deciding on the data stored in the user accounts, 
as well as managing access to the accounts. If a user leaves the group, their account will remain under the 
management of the line manager, who will ultimately decide what to do with the account. This ensures that 
access to our HPC facility is managed appropriately and that users are held accountable for their usage.
